This is outright wrong. First, look up CreateFile() in Windows; it has flags to specify things like this as well. Second, the reason programs delete files in the first place has nothing to do with the lack of such flags. It has to do with the fact that they want to write new contents but don&#x27;t want to lose data in the event of an abnormal termination. If you truncate the file that you&#x27;re opening instead, then you lose that data if something goes wrong. So they create a new file and replace it with the old one when it&#x27;s written.<p>Finally, as far as I know, &#x27;nix tools have a tendency to outright replace files MORE than Windows tools do.
